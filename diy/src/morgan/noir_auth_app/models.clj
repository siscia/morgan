;   can't serialize class org.joda.time.DateTime -
;                                 (class java.lang.IllegalArgumentException)
; See "custom type conversions" in

; Datetimes are stored in MongoDB as BSON's UTC DateTimes
;   http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Dates
; which the Java driver converts to java.util.Date objects. These objects
; do not contain time zone information
;   http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Date.html
; CongoMongo, in combination with the ConvertibleFromMongo extended protocol
; below, converts java.util.Date objects to org.joda.time.DateTime objects
;   #<DateTime 2012-08-07T22:04:53.558+02:00>
; These objects contain time zone information, as can be checked by trying
; this in the REPL
;   (.getZone (:created_at (somnium.congomongo/fetch-one :users)))
; getZone() is implemented by AbstractInstant, which is available through
; this class hierarchy
; org.joda.time.Date < BaseDateTime < AbstractDateTime < AbstractInstant
;   https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time/blob/master/src/main/java/org/joda/time/base/AbstractInstant.java
; When creating an org.joda.time.Date object, a time zone can be specified
;   https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time/blob/master/src/main/java/org/joda/time/DateTime.java
; Initially, no time zone was specified when these DateTime objects were
; created in the mongo->clojure function below, meaning that they were
; created with the default time zone, i.e. the server's time zone. They were
; created correctly, because the time in java.util.Date was interpreted as
; UTC, which it really was, and then changed appropriately according to the
; default time zone. However, this meant that by default these DateTimes were
; converted to strings for display using that time zone, ex. 
; 2012-06-16T21:30:17.001+02:00 , see toString in
;   https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time/blob/master/src/main/java/org/joda/time/base/AbstractInstant.java
; In order to get these DateTimes displayed in UTC by default, the UTC time
; zone is now specified when creating them.

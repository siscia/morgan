        ; Rails the action would typically be specified in href, but in
        ; Rails the action is specified with an HTTP method and a URL,
        ; while Granger's fetch library provides a higher level interface
        ; by which the action is simply specified with a remote function
        ; name, so it doesn't seem appropriate to put a function name where
        ; a URL is expected (actually, it might be ok if the function name
        ; were prefixed with something like "cljs:", similar to how
        ; the "javascript:" pseudo protocol prefix is used to put JavaScript
        ; code directly into an href, but then parsing that action value
        ; would be a little more complicated). Another reason to not put the
        ; function name in href is that if JavaScript is disabled, when
        ; clicking on the link the browser would try to open that, which
        ; would cause an error.

; In this case the taken email is in :new_requested_email .
; The same happens with the :email-taken error. To handle this, these
; errors are mapped to the keys of corresponding message strings that
; use the value of :new-requested-email instead of the value of :email.
;
; #TODO: maybe these should be considered different errors, and so the
; remapping be moved to the model (users/change-email!) ?
; But this would require that Noir provides a way to re-set the errors
; on a given field, and that doesn't seem to be possible currently, as
; the set-error function actually adds the error instead of replacing
; it. (I think the current set-error should probably be renamed to
; add-error and then provide a real set-error, like Rails' Errors#add
; and Errors#set methods.)

; Should the activation/password resets tokens expire? YES
; http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4515469/why-should-we-make-account-activation-password-reset-links-expire-after-some-tim
; See for example the following case, which may be entirely possible:
; Suppose I request a password reset, I get an email with the token, but I
; never use it. After that, someone gains access to my email account. I realize
; about that, and log in to services where I was registered with that email to
; change it with a new, uncompromised email address. With an expiring password
; reset token, I would be safe now. With a non-expiring password reset token,
; the user that got access to my old email account, it can still use the old
; password reset code to get access to my account in the corresponding
; service and change the password, and the email again, thus stealing my
; account.
; So, activation codes and password reset codes have been made expiring, see
; activate! and change-password-with-reset-code! in models/user.clj
;
; When the activation is successful, the user will be automatically logged in.
